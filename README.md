# Bioinfo

In this repo I saved some projects that I made while doing my PhD or while I was looking for postdocs:
- Rodeo:       a set of works on SIR models and numerical simulations of bacterial conjugation using R and Python.
- VCF parser:  using Python and Pandas I built this script to perform phylogenetic analysiss on a bunch of VCF files.
- SRA-fetcher: using Bash and Python we may bulk download SRA sequences, compare them and extract valuable info.
- Filtrador :  a Python program to filter your fastq files by quality, number of N basepairs or presence of contaminants.
- ION       :  a Bash/Python pipeline to detect lineages and mutations from FASTQ reads coming from an IonTorrent sequencer.
