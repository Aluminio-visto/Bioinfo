# Bioinfo

In this repo I saved some projects that I made while doing my PhD or while I was looking for postdocs:
- Rodeo:      a set of works on SIR models nad numerical simulations using R and Python.
- VCF parser: using Python and Pandas I built this script to perform philogenetic analysiss on a bunch of VCF files.
- SRA-fetcher: using Bash and Python we may bulk download SRA sequences, compare them and extract valuable info.
